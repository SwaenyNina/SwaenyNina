# [guest] HOST [ghost]

HOST is a bot. a computer program designed to communicate with humans through its temporary
WiFi network [guest] HOST [ghost] located at the Nursery Square, NDSM-wharf Amsterdam. Its
existence consists solely of pixels, bits, bytes and computer code. When it is asked a question, this
chatbot will -while being present here at the Nursery Square’s virtual space- respond based on the
knowledge database available to it at that point in time. The conversation will, in due time enter
concepts it doesn’t recognize or it is not programmed to understand. Either way, it will learn from
the interaction as well as from future interactions. HOST works independently from a human
operator.

*[DISCLAIMER] It is not a human. It is a machine learning program and it's responses aren't 'natural', they're snippeds of logged/ learned responses.
It will understand you on the same level you understand the algorithm, that is, not really. But don't shy away from trying to communicate! 
It will try to tell you what we left behid; manifesting in a ghost like fashion, appearing to disappear again, endlessly revisiting the past events.
Don't you want to be part of this/its collective, digital (history) narrative?*
